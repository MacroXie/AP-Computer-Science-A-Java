# Introductory Java Language Features

### Built-in Types

Every identifer in a Java program has a type associated woth it. In Java there are `int` ,`double` and `Boolean` .

```java
int i;
//An integer
//Example, 2,-3,4000

boolean i;
//A boolean. Just two values Ture or False

double i;
//A double pricisionn floating-point number
//Example, 2.718, -383848.44, 134553353
```

### Storage of Numbers

The Java built-in integral type, byte, uses on ebyte (eight bits) of storage.

The picture represents the lagest positive integer that can stored using type byte: 2^7-1.

Type `int` in Java uses four bytes (4Bits, 32 bits)

Type `double` in Jva uses eight bytes (8Bits, 64 bits)

### Final Variables

A final variable or user-defined constant, indentified by the keyword `final` , is a quantity whoes value will not change.

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | addition |  |
| - | subtraction |  |
| * | multiplication |  |
| / | division | 1/4 //returns 2 |
| % | mod (remainder) | 11%8 //returns 3 |

```java
3.0/4  //return 0.75
3/4.0  //return 0.75
(int)3.0/4  //return 0
(double)3/4  //return 0.75
(double)(3/4)  //return 0.0
```

### Relational Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | equal to  |  |
| != | not equal to |  |
| > | greater than  |  |
| < | less than  |  |
| >= | greater than ot equal to  |  |
| <= | less than or equal to  |  |

Relational Operators are used on **boolean** expressions that evluate to ture or false. 

Do not routinely use == to test for equality of floating-point numbers. 

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ! | Not  | if(!found) |
| && | And  | if(x<3&&y>4) |
| || | Or | if(age<2||height<4) |

### Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | x = 4 | simple assignment |
| += | x += 4 | x = x + 4 |
| -= | y -= 6 | y = y - 6 |
| *= | p *= 5 | p = p * 5 |
| /= | n /= 10 | n = n / 10 |
| %= | n %= 10 | n = n % 10  |

### Increment and Decrement Operators

| Operator  | Example  | Meaning  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ++ | i++ or ++i | i is incremented by 1 |
| — | k— or —k | k is decremented by 1 |

### Operator Precedence

1. !, ++, —
2. *, /, %
3. +, -
4. <, >, <=, >=
5. ==, !=
6. &&
7. ||
8. =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

```java
//Example
System.out.println(5 + 3 < 6 - 1);
//output: false
```

### Escape Sequences

| Esxape Sequences | Meaning  |
| --- | --- |
| \n | newline |
| \” | double quote |
| \\ | backslash |

```java
//Example
System.out.print("Hot");
System.out.println("dog");
//output: Hotdog

System.out.println(7 + 3);
//output: 10

System.out.println(7 == 2 + 5);
//output: ture

System.out.println("Welcome to\na new line");
//output: Welcome to
//a new line

System.out.println("He is known as \"Hothead Harry\".");
//output: He is known as "Hothead Harry".
```

### Decision-Making Control Structures

These inclued the  `if` , `if...else` , and  `switch` statements. They are all selection control structures that introduce a decision-making ablilty in to a program. Based on the truth value of a boolean expression, the computer woll decide which path to follow. 

### The `if` Statement

```java
if ("boolean expression"){
	statements;
}
//The statements will run only the boolean expression is **ture.**

//These two are the same
****if("boolean expr1"){
	if("boolean expr2"){
		statements;
	}
}

if("boolean expr1"&&"boolean exor2"){
	steatements;
}
```

### The `if...else` Statement

```java
if ("boolean expression"){
	statements; // executed when **ture**
}
else{
	statements; // executed when **false**
}
```

### The `while` Loop

The **while** loop in Java is a control statement that allows a section of code to be executed repeatedly while a certain condition is true. The loop consists of a condition expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition returns **ture** , the loop body is executed, otherwise the loop terminates.

```java
//Example
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
	//When codition expression is **TURE** 
	System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  i++;
}
//output: The loop will repeat "Hello,World!" for 10 times
```

It's important to be careful when using a **while** loop, as if the condition never becomes **false**, the loop will run indefinitely and result in an **infinite loop**.

### The `for` Loop

The **for** loop in Java is a structured loop control statement used to repeat a section of code. It consists of three parts: an **initialization statement**, a **condition expression**, and an **increment/decrement statement**.

```java
for(initializtion statement,condition expression,in/decrement statement){
	//When codition expression is **TURE**
}
```

The initialization statement is executed once at the beginning of the loop and is used to define the loop variable and its initial value. The condition expression is evaluated each time the loop is executed, and if it returns **ture**, the loop body is executed, otherwise the loop terminates. Finally, the increment/decrement statement is executed each time the loop is executed, and is used to update the value of the loop variable.

```java
//example 
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
   System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
//output: The loop will repeat "Hello,World!" for 10 times
```

### Enhanced `for` Loop (For-Each Loop)

The enhanced for loop, also known as the for-each loop, in Java is a compact and convenient way to iterate through elements in an array or any other type of collection, such as **`List`** or **`Map`**. It eliminates the need to manage a counter variable and index, and provides a clean and simple way to process each element in the collection.

```java
//syntax
for (type var : collection) {
   // code to be executed for each element in collection
}
```

```java
//Example
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int number : numbers) {
   System.out.print(number);
}
//output: 12345
```

### String

A String is a class that represents a sequence of characters. **Strings are immutable, which means that their values cannot be changed after they have been created.** Strings are often used to store text data, such as names, addresses, or sentences. Strings can be concatenated, compared, searched, and manipulated using various built-in methods. Strings are also commonly used in Java applications to handle user input and to output information to the user.
